Introduction the TM Lookup Tool
======
This sample project provides a step-by-step guide of how to develop a custom application that allows you to perform common translation memory lookup operations.

Looking up information in a TM database is one of the most common applications of the Translation Memory API. For example, you may want to integrate TM lookup functionality in a third-party application, which allows you to carry out concordance searches in a TM from a Web-based CMS.

The simple C# application which we are going to develop should allow for the following:

* Select a TM (file-based or server-based)
* Perform concordance searches which return matching TUs with additional information such as fields and the creation date.
* Perform concordance searches in the source or target language


This simplified sample application is a case in point of how to implement TM search functionality in other applications, e.g. integrate TM lookup functions into a 3rd party application or design custom TM lookup user interfaces.
